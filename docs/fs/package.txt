PACKAGE DOCUMENTATION

package fs
    import "github.com/materials-commons/gohandy/fs"

    Package fs implements a recursive file system watcher. This code is
    based on code from
    https://github.com/gophertown/looper/blob/master/watch.go.


TYPES

type Event struct {
    *fsnotify.FileEvent
}
    Event is a structure that wraps the fsnotify.FileEvent. The reason we
    don't expose fsnotify.FileEvent directly is to allow for future
    expansion of state information in the Event struct.



type RecursiveWatcher struct {
    *fsnotify.Watcher            // File system watcher
    Events            chan Event // The channel to send events on
    ErrorEvents       chan error
}
    RecursiveWatcher represents the file system watcher and communication
    channels.


func NewRecursiveWatcher(path string) (*RecursiveWatcher, error)
    NewRecursiveWatcher creates a new file system watcher for path. It walks
    the directory tree at path adding each directory to the watcher. When
    the user creates a new directory it is also added to the list of
    directories to watch.


func (watcher *RecursiveWatcher) Start()
    Start starts monitoring for file system events and sends the events on
    the Events channel. It also handles directory create events by adding
    the newly created directory to the list of directories to monitor.
